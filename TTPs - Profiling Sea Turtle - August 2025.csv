Tactic,ID,Technique,Procedure (Context)
Initial Access,T1078.004,Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts,"Sea Turtle used stolen AWS IAM keys or Azure Entra ID credentials to authenticate and access cloud environments, enabling unauthorized API calls."
Execution,T1059.009,Command and Scripting Interpreter: Cloud API,"Executed malicious commands via AWS CLI or Azure CLI/PowerShell to manage resources (AWS: EC2, S3, IAM; Azure: VMs, Blob Storage, Entra ID)."
Persistence,T1543.005,Create or Modify System Process: Container Services,Sea Turtle altered security group settings to allow SSH access (port 22) from malicious infrastructure to cloud instances. This modification ensures persistent remote access to cloud instances.
Defense Evasion,T1578,Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure,"The threat actor has modified security group settings to open SSH access from their infrastructure, bypassing network restrictions and enabling direct instance access. This change blends with legitimate administrative actions to evade detection."
Collection,T1530,Data from Cloud Storage,"Sea Turtle has targeted data stored in the victimâ€™s cloud environment, likely accessing S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS databases, Azure VMs, or Storage blobs. The use of stolen credentials and CLI access suggests querying or downloading sensitive data during the intrusion."
Command and Control,T1071,Application Layer Protocol,"SSH access to EC2s or VMs from malicious infrastructure likely used standard application-layer protocols (TCP/22) for command and control, allowing the threat actor to manage compromised instances remotely."
Exfiltration,T1041,Exfiltration Over C2 Channel,"If data was exfiltrated, Sea Turtle likely transferred it to actor-controlled infrastructure using the established C2 mechanism mentioned (i.e., SSH). This is inferred from the goal of targeting stored data."
