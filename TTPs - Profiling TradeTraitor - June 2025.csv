Resource Development,T1586.003,Establish Accounts: Cloud Accounts,"The threat actor registered the domain getstockprice[.]com via Namecheap, establishing infrastructure for the initial access payload and AWS C2 traffic."
Initial Access,T1195.002,Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain,"The threat actor compromised Safe{Wallet}, a third-party wallet provider in Bybit’s supply chain, by injecting malicious JavaScript into its AWS S3 bucket hosting app.safe.global. This manipulated Bybit’s multisig transaction on stealing $1.5 billion in ETH. "
Initial Access,T1078.004,Valid Accounts: Cloud Accounts,"The threat actor compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s macOS workstation, stealing AWS credentials (likely S3 or CloudFront API keys). These credentials granted access to Safe{Wallet}’s AWS infrastructure enabling reconnaissance and subsequent S3 bucket manipulation. "
Persistence,T1136.003,Create Account: Cloud Account,"There is a realistic probability that the threat actor created or modified IAM users/roles in Safe{Wallet}’s AWS environment to maintain access. While not publicly confirmed, the 12-day dwell time and modus operandi suggests IAM manipulation to ensure persistent S3 access. For example, the actor unsuccessfully attempted to register a virtual MFA device indicating an attempt at establishing persistence. "
Defense Evasion,T1562.008,Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"The threat actor removed malicious JavaScript from the S3 bucket, minimizing CloudTrail evidence (e.g., DeleteObject events). "
Defense Evasion,T1578.002,Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Modify Security Groups,"The threat actor injected malicious JavaScript into Safe{Wallet}’s AWS S3 bucket, targeting Bybit’s Ethereum wallet. The code, hosted in _app-52c9031bfa03da47.js, altered transaction payloads. "
Discovery,T1526,Cloud Service Discovery,"The threat actor almost certainly conducted reconnaissance in Safe{Wallet}’s AWS environment after gaining access with stolen credentials. Over a 12-day period, activities likely included the following: understanding the AWS infrastructure, enumerating S3 buckets, IAM roles, or CloudFront distributions to identify the app.safe.global bucket for JavaScript injection."
Impact,T1496,Resource Hijacking,"Safe{Wallet}’s AWS S3 bucket was hijacked to host malicious JavaScript, enabling the theft. "
Impact,T1657,Financial Theft,The incident resulted in a $1.5 billion ETH theft from ByBit.
